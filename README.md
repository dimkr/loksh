## Overview

loksh is a [Linux](https://www.kernel.org/) port of [OpenBSD](http://www.openbsd.org/)'s *ksh*.

Unlike other ports of *ksh*, loksh targets only one platform, follows upstream closely and keeps changes to a minimum. loksh does not add any extra features; this reduces the risk of introducing security vulnerabilities and makes loksh a good fit for resource-constrained systems.

## Legal Information

loksh is licensed under the same license as the upstream code it is based on.

The ASCII art logo at the top was made using [FIGlet](http://www.figlet.org/).
